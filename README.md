## Features

- **API Consumption**: Integrates with an external tea API to provide information on various tea types.
- **Custom Endpoints**: Implements custom API endpoints for managing tea subscriptions.
- **RESTful API Design**: Follows best practices for RESTful API design, ensuring intuitive and standardized routes.
- **Robust Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage using RSpec, focusing on unit, feature, and request specs.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a back-end API that handles tea subscription management for customers. Users can subscribe to different types of teas and manage their subscriptions (create, cancel, view all).

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

- **Ruby version**: `2.7.4` or later

- **PostgreSQL**: Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed and running

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/zach-bergman/the_tea.git
    cd the_tea
    ```

2. Install the required gems:

    ```bash
    bundle install
    ```

3. Set up the database:

    ```bash
    rails db:create
    rails db:migrate
